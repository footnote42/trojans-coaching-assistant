## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic API)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Deployment:** Replit (development) / TBD (production)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Anthropic API key (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/footnote42/trojans-coaching-assistant.git
   cd trojans-coaching-assistant
```

2. **Navigate to client directory**
```bash
   cd client
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   npm install
```

4. **Start development server**
```bash
   npm run dev
```

5. **Open in browser**
```
   http://localhost:5173
```

### Note on API Access

The Claude API integration requires an Anthropic API key. During development/testing, the application can be accessed via the [Claude.ai shared artifact link](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b1063080-9538-4ace-9ab3-76ca48ace623) which provides free API access.

For production deployment with your own API key, environment variables need to be configured (documentation coming soon).

## How It Works

1. **Select age group** (U6-U18) and session parameters
2. **Describe your coaching challenge** (e.g., "Players struggle with support play in attack")
3. **Generate session plan** - Claude creates a complete plan including:
   - Session purpose aligned to Trojans Framework
   - Equipment list
   - Safety brief
   - Progressive activities (warm-up, skill zones, game zones, cool down)
   - Coaching organization notes
   - Review questions
   - Regulation 15 compliance check
   - YouTube resource suggestions
4. **Copy and use** - WhatsApp summary for parents, full plan for coaches
